# Conference Twitter Bot

## Scheduling Tweets about Papers and Presentations with Ease

The Conference Twitter Bot is a system to run Twitter accounts for
academic conferences and workshops. The main aim is to support
you in selecting and curating Tweets to advertise and promote the research
presented at an event.

Instead of giving the authors exposure at a single point in time in the year,
we want to help others to find research more easily by making it available
on platforms such as Twitter.

The key features are:
 - retrieving paper details from platforms such the ACM Digital Library and Researchr.org
 - composing tweets for papers with customizable templates
 - scheduling them tweets in relatively regular intervals to avoid overload and encourage engagement

### Build With

To simplify development, this project tries to stick to a few basic technologies:

 - TypeScript as language for frontend and backend
 - JQuery and Mustache templates on the client
 - Node.js with [Koa](https://koajs.com/) on the server
 - Jest for testing
 - npm for building
